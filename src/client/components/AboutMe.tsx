					Hello! I'm Kevin, a full stack engineer from the United States. I have a passion for building and designing web applications. I'm a firm believer in the power of technology to solve problems and make life easier. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading, or playing video games.
